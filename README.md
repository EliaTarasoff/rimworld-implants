This mod adds more implants to Rimworld.
Most of them have terrible trade-offs...

## Body-Parts
- lungs that give resistance to toxic fallout
- eyes that give a work-speed buff
- caffeine-drip kidneys that give a boost to sleep and consciousness

## Symbiotes
- stomach: less food needed
- heart: less pain, more speed, immunity gain speed
- spine: better moving, manipulation
- psychic: better talking and hearing
