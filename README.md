This mod adds more implants to Rimworld.
Most of them have terrible trade-offs...

## Body-Parts
- lungs that give resistance to toxic fallout
- eyes that give a work-speed buff
- caffeine-drip kidneys that give a boost to sleep and consciousness
- nose that gives bonuses to animal hunting and handling

## Symbiotes
- stomach: less food needed
- heart: less pain, more speed, immunity gain speed
- spine: better moving, manipulation
- psychic: better talking and hearing

## TODO
- hyperlink all the things back to each other: `<descriptionHyperlinks><ThingDef>FOO</ThingDef></descriptionHyperlinks>`
    - it's a list: can have multiple `ThingDef` tags
    - also `<RecipeDef>`
    - also `<HediffDef>`
